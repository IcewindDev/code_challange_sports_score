#Assumptions and clarifications

    - Directories:
        - Models => holding data models
        - Resources => used for prepring any data needed for the code to run
        - Services => used for business logic
        - Test => used for unit tests
        - Helpers => any other logic needed that would not have a match any of the above
    # I am not sure if all will be needed after I finish the challange
    
    - External libaries
        - I will avoid using any external libraries which would do a better job at autoloading classes, data storing/mapping, writing unit test
    
    - I would assume that it would be better to use a language like node to handle any data real time using websockets, however, the current implementation will be in php
